# Student-Mark-Entry-Logic
A simple student mark entry logic executed in Python. This is developed to learn 'How to interact with the database'. This program gets the marks of students as input and stores the marks with the respected grades and the average of each student.
I have used MySQL database and Python language to achieve the task.
